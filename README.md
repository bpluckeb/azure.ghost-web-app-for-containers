Basically, this is a multi-container app specified in [a Docker Compose configuration](https://github.com/andrewmatveychuk/azure.ghost-web-app-for-containers/blob/master/docker-compose.yml) and hosted on [Azure Web App for Containers](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/app-service/containers/).

The Azure Web app configuration is provided as a ready-to-use ARM template that deploys and configures all requires Azure resources:

* a Web app and App Hosting plan for running the containers;
* a Key Vault for storing secrets such as database passwords;
* a Log Analytics workspace and Application Insights component for monitoring the application;
* an [Azure CDN](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cdn/) profile and endpoint for offloading the traffic from the Web app _or_ an [Azure Front Door](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/frontdoor/) endpoint with a [WAF policy](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/web-application-firewall/afds/afds-overview).
